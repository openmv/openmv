# Iris Detection 2 Example
#
# This example shows how to find the eye gaze (pupil detection) after finding
# the eyes in an image. This script uses the find_eyes function which determines
# the center point of roi that should contain a pupil. It does this by basically
# finding the center of the darkest area in the eye roi which is the pupil center.
#
# Note: This script does not detect a face first, use it with the telephoto lens.

    # Note: Lower scale factor scales-down the image more and detects smaller objects.
    # Higher threshold results in a higher detection rate, with more false positives.
    eyes = img.find_features(eyes_cascade, threshold=0.5, scale_factor=1.5)
