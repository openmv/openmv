# Negative Example
#
# This example shows off negating the image. This is not a particularly
# useful method but it can come in handy once in a while.

import csi
import time

csi0 = csi.CSI()
csi0.reset()  # Initialize the camera sensor.
csi0.pixformat(csi.RGB565)  # or csi.GRAYSCALE
csi0.framesize(csi.QVGA)  # or csi.QQVGA (or others)
csi0.snapshot(time=2000)  # Let new settings take affect.

clock = time.clock()  # Tracks FPS.

while True:
    clock.tick()  # Track elapsed milliseconds between snapshots().
    img = csi0.snapshot().negate()

    print(clock.fps())  # Note: Your OpenMV Cam runs about half as fast while
    # connected to your computer. The FPS should increase once disconnected.
