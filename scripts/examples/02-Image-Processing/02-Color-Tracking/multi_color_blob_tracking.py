# Color Tracking Thresholds (L Min, L Max, A Min, A Max, B Min, B Max)
# The below thresholds track in general red/green things. You may wish to tune them...

    (0, 15, 0, 40, -80, -20),

# You may pass up to 16 thresholds above. However, it's not really possible to segment any
# scene with 16 thresholds before color thresholds start to overlap heavily.
