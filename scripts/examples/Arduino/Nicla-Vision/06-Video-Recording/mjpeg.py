# MJPEG Video Recording Example
#
# Note: You will need an SD card to run this demo.
#
# You can use your OpenMV Cam to record mjpeg files. You can either feed the
# recorder object JPEG frames or RGB565/Grayscale frames. Once you've finished
# recording a Mjpeg file you can use VLC to play it. If you are on Ubuntu then
# the built-in video player will work too.

sensor.set_framesize(sensor.QVGA) # or sensor.QQVGA (or others)
sensor.skip_frames(time = 2000) # Let new settings take affect.
clock = time.clock() # Tracks FPS.

pyb.LED(RED_LED_PIN).on()
sensor.skip_frames(time = 2000) # Give the user time to get ready.
